        "📚 Break study into smaller, manageable sessions: Focus on one concept at a time, like Faraday's Law or Lenz's Law, to avoid feeling overwhelmed.",
        "💡 Take regular breaks to keep your mind fresh: After studying for 45-50 minutes, take a 10-minute break to recharge and improve your retention.",
        "📝 Use active recall and spaced repetition: Test yourself frequently on key concepts like magnetic fields and electromagnetic induction to enhance understanding.",
        "🌟 Stay organized and plan ahead: Use a planner to schedule your study sessions and set goals for each, so you can track your progress and cover all topics methodically.",
        "🔬 Utilize visual aids and practical experiments: Explore electromagnetism through diagrams, simulations, and simple experiments to make abstract concepts concrete and memorable."
